# Library Database creation and Exploration
In this project I have created a database called Library with a number of tables like:
1. books
2. branch
3. employees
4. issued_status
5. return_status
6. members

- During this project I also managed to create an ERD(Entity Relationship Diagram) which is a visual representation of how different tables in a database are related to each other.
- I followed this procedure:
     - Clicked on file on the DBeaver userinterface
     - Then to 'New'
     - DBeaver
     - ER Diagram
     - Then dragged the tables into the ERD and created the relationship based on PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY
     - If you want to save the image, right click on the image the to 'Save As'

### Data Exploration Techniques
- Managed to use JOINS; INNER and LEFT JOINS
- INSERT
- UPDATE
- HAVING
- GROUP BY
